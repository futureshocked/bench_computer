Since Bullseye no longer supports Picamera, we need to use Picamera2 to access the RPi camera functionality.

I put together a few script files that do some of the same things that were discussed in the lectures while using Picamaera.

I also included a pdf file that outlines some of the Picamera2 functionality plus outlines what is in the script files which I included.  Some of the script files might have more than you need but they do get the job done.
